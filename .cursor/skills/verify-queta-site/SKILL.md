# Verify Queta site

Project-local verification for the Queta AI marketing replica.

## Launch

From the repo root:

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
npm run build
npm run verify
```

`npm run verify` runs lint, typecheck, build, starts `next start` on port 3005 (override with `VERIFY_BASE_URL`), drives routes, writes evidence, then tears down the server.

Ready when the verify base URL returns HTTP 200 (default `http://127.0.0.1:3005/`).

Teardown: the verify script stops the `next start` process it started and removes `.verification-dev-server.pid`. Do not kill processes by name.

## Doctor

Before driving after a failed run:

```bash
test ! -f .verification-dev-server.pid || echo "stale pid file"
curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:3005/ >/dev/null && echo "verify port in use" || echo "verify port free"
node -v
npm run typecheck
```

Doctor passes when the verify port is free (unless you intentionally run the verify server), Node is 24.x, and typecheck succeeds.

## Drive

Primary harness: `scripts/verify-site.mjs` via `npm run verify`.

Routes (must return 200 on replica and original):

- `/`
- `/pricing`
- `/about`
- `/contact`
- `/solutions/lifestyle`
- `/solutions/realtor`
- `/solutions/trader`
- `/solutions/office-manager`

For each route and for both `replica` and `original` bases, the script:

1. Loads the page with Playwright (`load`, short settle).
2. Records HTTP status, console errors, failed network requests, and broken images.
3. Saves full-page PNGs at 1280×720 and 390×844.

### Contact form (mocked FormSubmit)

After the replica server is up, `scripts/verify-contact-form.mjs` runs inside the same verify pass:

1. Mocks `https://formsubmit.co/ajax/info@queta.ai` so no real email is sent.
2. Drives a successful submit on `/contact?interest=waitlist` and saves `contact-form-success.png`.
3. Mocks HTTP 500 and drives a failed submit on `/contact`, saving `contact-form-error.png`.
4. Asserts the mocked POST includes `_captcha: false`, empty `_honey`, and `_subject` starting with `New Queta AI contact`.

Compare side-by-side pairs under `verification-evidence/<runId>/`:

- `replica-<route>-desktop.png` next to `original-<route>-desktop.png`
- same for `-mobile.png`

## Evidence

Output directory: `verification-evidence/<iso-run-id>/`

Artifacts:

- `summary.json` — per-route audit results and contact form check results
- `verify.log` — one-line per route summary
- PNG screenshots for replica and original
- `contact-form-success.png` and `contact-form-error.png`

Proof standards:

- Every mapped route returns HTTP 200 on the replica with zero console errors and zero broken images.
- Contact form success and error flows pass with FormSubmit mocked (no live email in CI).
- Lint, typecheck, and `next build` exit 0 inside the same verify run.
- Side-by-side screenshots are the visual parity record; layout and copy should match queta.ai closely.

## Cleanup

The verify script stops the server it started. If a run aborts mid-flight:

```bash
kill "$(cat .verification-dev-server.pid)" 2>/dev/null || true
rm -f .verification-dev-server.pid
```

Never delete `verification-evidence/`.

## Helpers

```bash
npm run verify
node scripts/verify-site.mjs
node scripts/verify-contact-form.mjs
```
